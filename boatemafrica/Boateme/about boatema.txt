Boatema Africa (formally MUDHOUSE) is an African inspired fashion brand that uses African prints to create master pieces that promote African culture. Boatema Africa uses prints like Adire (Tie, Dye & Batik), real mudcloth/Bogolan, and art infusion to create its desings. 
At Boatema Africa, we believe art shouldn't be placed on the walls alone, art should also be worn.
